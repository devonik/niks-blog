description: Table tennis is one of my passions. I packed my own racket in my backpack, and I found professional table tennis clubs around the world. So far I've played in Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, and the list is going to be longer.

### Thailand

In Thailand I played in 3 different clubs. In phuket, Ko samui and ko phangan.

#### Phuket

On the highest level in the Big C Shopping Mall, you will find the club. This club is offering group training, tournaments on weekends, and individual coaching.
The best is to contact the owner via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/phuket_table_tennis?igsh=cmJnMnBrM2c4cWM1){:target="_blank"}. You should contact him before you go; otherwise, it might be full.

I just went there on a Thursday, but the tournament was already full. After that I listed myself for the 'Master Cup' tournament on Sunday. It was very fun but also very difficult. Some players there are professional. I went out in the group phase. Definitely recommended for players that are looking for a challenge.

#### Ko samui

::

This location is a sports center and contains a gym, an area for badminton, and an area for 4 table tennis tables. The location is easy to find. I made the mistake of just going there, and I couldn't find anyone. I highly recommend joining the community Telegram chat and asking for a time to play. In the group were around 8 people; we warmed up a while, and then we played matches against each other. It was a lot of fun. :)

You can rent the place individually with friends, or there is a group that meets around 10:00 or 13:00. For the group training, the best is to ask in their [Telegram group](https://t.me/samuitable){:target="_blank"}.

#### Ko Phangan

I couldn't go because I had a motorcycle accident days before :/. But I contacted them via Telegram, and after messaging with the owner, they wanted to do a tournament. There is no official schedule, so you should contact them via [Telegram](https://t.me/TableTennisPhangan){:target="_blank"}

### Philipines

#### Manila

The place is in a shopping mall (like all activities in Manila :D) on the first floor. I just went there on a weekday around 12:00, but sadly there was only the coach coaching a kid. After waiting a bit, there was a local; we played for some hours, and he is now a wonderful friend of mine :). Definitely recommended to go here for some relaxed playtime. No tournament here; you organize things yourself.

You can organize a private session with the host; just go with friends, or you can go any day around 18:00 / 19:00. At this time, the most people are coming.

There is no official schedule. If you just go solo, you have to hope there is someone (good chances at 18:00 / 19:00). I recommend contacting the owner, **Kevin Olivio** via Facebook.

There is also a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/257339569712/?ref=share&mibextid=KtfwRi){:target="_blank"} for table tennis in the Philippines (Facebook is really famous here).

### Vietnam

#### Ho chi minh / Saigon

Very local place. I don't really know the schedule. I just went there in the afternoon and could play with them. Really strong players
There is no official schedule. You have to just go there or go with a friend

I went here spontaneously. I was near and had luck that there were some locals. One of them was really friendly and played with me. After some warmup, we play singles and doubles. I must say they all were very good. I had no chance at all.

Do you know **Ti Long's Youtube channel** ? Who doesn't know this grandmaster with his excellent table tennis tips. I found his club here in the city :) Unfortunately I had no time to go here. I could contact him via What's App +84 90 942 30 06 and get a private session combined with a group session.

#### Nha Thrang

I just went here on a weekday at 18:00. That was a good time. At this time you can find some locals and play with them
There is no official schedule. You have to just go there or go with a friend.

Caution: when you make a route from the beachside (southeast of Nha Trang), Google Maps will route you through a military area you cannot pass. That was a strange experience, :D so just take the main road, and at one point you turn left (see the picture). It's a bit tricky to find, but you will see 2 big tennis courts, and when you go through the middle, you will find the entry to the table tennis area.

#### Da nang

I went here one day to ask what time is the best, and the next day I went at 18:00. On the first floor are some kids playing with coaches. On the first floor you can find other adult players you just can play with. There was no player free, so the coach played with me.

The best time here to find other players is 18:00, or you can book a coach.

#### Hoi an

That was super fun. Super friendly locals. On both days I went here, the coach was playing with me in some practices. After that, I played some matches with other players. I definitely recommend this place. This place is a bit tricky to find. It's a side entry of a school. Take a look at the picture above to find the place where you can enter the door.

For more questions, you can find the host, **Vuong Le** on Facebook.

### Indonesia

#### Sorong

That was super fun. Who thought I would find a place to play in Sorong? At first I wanted to check out the place to hear what time is the best, but I couldn't find the location. The Google Maps marker is 100-200 m wrong; :( look in the picture above for the correct route. Finally, I found the place, and the guy said 18:00. So I went in the same day, and I was surprised by a lot of kids staring at me haha. I felt like a superstar. The people were sooo friendly, they instantly wanted to play with me. At the end we took a lot of pictures together. :D

Be ready to play with some very cute kids. :)

I just went here but had no luck finding players. The coach told me the best is to contact him via WhatsApp +62 821-4726-2183 and have a private session. It's not possible to find here other players to play with. The coach is really friendly and experienced. I can definitely recommend the coaching.
You can also bring your own friends and rent a table.
