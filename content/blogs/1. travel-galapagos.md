    <span class="text-xs text-gray-600">I will share my Google Maps list. After you click on the image, you can save it in your Google Maps as an external list.</span>
</div>

Note: all prices and locations have been visited by me in May 2025, and I cannot guarantee that it's still the same when you read this.

#### Money: cash or card

I definitely recommend calculating your expenses in advance and withdrawing US dollars in advance. I am happy that I did so.

On Santa Cruz are many places like restaurants, shops, and even the dive centers you can pay with a card. But sometimes there are transaction fees, like 4%, and this can be a lot if you pay for trips like diving.

On Isabela, I haven't seen any possibility to pay with a card.

On San Cristobal it's the same as on Santa Cruz. You can pay by card in dive centers, but there is mostly a transaction fee.

In general, the modern locations (expensive restaurants, etc.) offer card payment, but all local shops, restaurants, etc. only take cash.

There are ATMs on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal. Isabela, I haven't seen one. I just withdrew once in San Cristóbal at the yellow ATM, and I got $500 (I think it's the limit, but sadly the ATMs do not say what the limit is, so you have to try), and I paid a $4.60 fee, which is not bad.
I often heard there is a limit of $200 per transaction, and sometimes the ATMs are out of notes.

#### Tipps to get cash in Quito

I stayed before in Quito and knew in average what I will spend (especially with the diving costs). I calculated with up to 3 diving trips per week.

In Quito are many different banks. I tried a few of them. I tried to avoid as many fees as I could, and I'll show you my experience.

- Banco Guayaquil
- - These ATMs are the best. I could withdraw a maximum of $500 and only paid a $0.52 fee. But there is a max of $500 per day, so I recommend starting to withdraw some days before.
- Banco del Austro
- - This is my second choice, with a max of $500 and a $4.50 fee.
- Banco Internacional
- - This bank is recommended for no fees by many, such as the internet and the hostel I stayed in. But my experience was different, and I had a maximum of $500 and a $5 fee. Maybe it depends on what bank you have.

In general, the ATMs only have $20 and $10 notes, so be ready to travel with a lot of notes... I felt like a drug dealer with this bunch of money. :D

#### Hint for coffee lovers (as me)

Be prepared; it's very hard to find good and affordable coffee on the islands. Either it's instant coffee or it costs up to $5 (insane!). There are few locations where you can find ok'isch non-instant coffee for $2–2.50. I will list my places to go in each island section.

When I go again to the Galápagos, I will bring a hand filter or French press and buy ground coffee on the mainland (check if you can bring coffee here because they have a lot of restrictions on what to bring on the island). With that, I will have a good-quality coffee at any time and save a lot of money!

#### Hint for scuba diving

Each island works different. It is recommended to book diving in advance to save your spot. Since I spend a long time here I'm flexible so I'm just going on the islands without any pre-bookings to get last minute prices. On Santa Cruz it's worth to book the diving in person since you can save up to 100$! As example:

- Iguana charge 290$ in advance and 190$ in person
- Shark Bay charge 240$ in advance and 180$ in person

Some divespots are indeed fully booked but if you've atleast a week in Santa Cruz you can still find a spot. Surprisingly Gordon Rocks - the most famous spot here - was never full booked but I guess it's because you need atleast 25 dives for this.
In general I was sursprised that here are so many divers with low experience. All other divespots in Santa Cruz can be visited by any dive experience. Even discovery dives are possible. The average count of dives from the people I met: 10 - 25 :o

On Isabla exists only one dive center and it has a really bad reputation. Even the host of my hostel said me about this and many more people. I also saw many bad reviews in Google Maps. I head stories about bad smelling air, unexperienced dive masters and once even that there were deaths in the past. Anyway I think in Isabla are not even good divespots

On San Cristobal there are some divespots including the famous Kicker Rock. Here it works different with the last minute prices and when you get them it's almost the same you pay in advance. I am also booking the diving here in person but as said before the price is the same as on the website.

For the most payments there is one thing: Many dive center using WeTravel and you pay 4% fee if you pay with card. So also here I recommend to bring cash to save the 4%, what can be alot with these prices.

### Get on the Island from the mainland

Ecuador has 2 airports that have flights to Santa Cruz or San Cristobal. Either fly from Guayaquill or Quito. I stayed before Galapagos in Quito for 7 days and I enjoyed it a lot.

I had a dorm room in the hostel "The secret garden" and I can recommend it! This hostel has been the best hostel I had in South America so far. The beds are very comfortable, it has a curtain (what is surprisingly rar in south america) the food is really good, they offer a 3 hours free walking tour everyday at 9am and the rooftop is amazing!

- Room price: ~ 5-7$
- Airport Taxi: 20$
- Breakfast: Srambled egg 1,80$, cappuchino 2$ //TODO have to check again
- Family dinner at 7pm (list yourself in the list before 11am to get a free desert!): //TODO have to check price.

After Galapagos I will stay in the same hostel in Quito again. From Galapagos the airline usually flight as the first stopp to Guayaquill but I decided to take a connection flight to Quito cause I don't want to stay in Guayaquill since I heard from many people it is very dangerous at the moment.

The prices of the flight to Santa Cruz or San Cristobal were about the same. I decided to fly to Santa Cruz cause it's the main Island and it's a good location to start. But I didn't know that the Airport in Santa Cruz is pretty far away from the town. After I landed I had to take a 10 minute bus to a pier, then a 10 minute boat, then a 40 minute bus to the town.

- Flight from Quito to Santa Cruz: 176$
- First bus to the pier: 5$
- Second bus to the town: 8$ (alternative is a taxi for 20$)

The airport in San Cristobal is just 10-20 minutes from the town. I am happy that I will have my return flight von San Cristobal.

### Santa Cruz

- Where I stayed: 9 nights in "Hostal al Mar" for 18$ per night in a 4 beds dorm. 5 nights in "Hostal Darwin" for 18$ per night in a private room. I recommend al Mar for socializing and darwin if you want a private room for a good price.
- Cheap local restaurants: 6$
- Coffee: 2,50$ - 5$
- Last minute scuba diving with Iguana: 190$
- Last minute scuba diving with Shark Bay: 180$
- Cash vs Card: On Santa Cruz you can pay in many places with card but often there is a fee (as the 4% in dive centers). In the modern restaurants you can often pay with card without any fee. For local restaurants, shops etc. you definitly need cash.

Once I arrived in the town I was surprised about the size and infrastructure of the town. I guess I expected an simple island kind of structure. Here are many many shops, restaurants and everything else you could need.

#### Things you can do without a guide

On my first day I went to the **Charles Darwin research center** and 2 beaches near by. I've seen there my first big tortoise on land and a lot of iguanas :) It's just 20 minutes walking from town and it's a great place to go if you just looking for somethin easy for 1-2 hours. And the information in the research center are very interesting and I am so glad to see all the programs that they're doing to preserve the nature.

Another great place to go is **Tortuga Bay** For me it has one of the most beautiful beaches on Santa Cruz and it has 2 beaches you can visit. It is a 40 minutes walk from town and you don't have to pay any entrance. As first I arrived in the big beach that has a beautiful sandy area with cristal clear water. The waves and current can be strong here so it's not recommended to swim, aswell it is pretty shallow. Anyway it's famous as a surf spot so if you can surf its a lot of fun. You can take lessons or rent a surf board in town for 20$ / day (until 6pm). I tried once surfing but im still a beginner with around 10 lessons I had. Sadly they only had very short boards and I struggled a lot to catch any wave, but it was nice to see the difference from long board to short board. Aswell it wasn't easy to carry the board 40 minutes from town to the beach - I guess it's quite impossible to carry a long board.

After the big beach around the corner there is a smaller, beautiful and very calm beach (I think the name was Playa Mensa). Here you can swim and take a nap on the beach (But try to keep dry after you coming out of the water or the horse flies will eat you :D They're super annoying and wanna bite you if you're wet). You can also rent a kayak here by your own for 10$. I did this 2 times with friends I met. We went up to the end of the left site of the mangroves and on the way back we made multiple stops to see a lot of turtles, black- and white tip sharks, sometimes a iguana swimming by and when you're lucky you can see one or more eagle rays from the kayak :)

#### Snorkeling and other trips

- Tour 180: 130$ last minute
- Santa Fé: 110$ last minute

There are many snorkeling trips you can do. I did 2 different tours. The first I did is called 180 Tour and I visited Isla Pinzon, one beautiful beach in the north of Santa Cruz and Isla Daphne. My highlight here was that I swimmed the first time with sea lions and it was amazing! The water was pretty cold in May (21 or 22 degrees I guess) and I recommend to rent a wet suit before you go (often the agencies offering for 5$).

My second trip was at Santa Fé. I had 2 snorkelings here so we just moved around the island for the second. I think this is the cheapest snorkeling trip you can do here. Especially the second snorkel spot was amazing. It was a rock formation with **many** sea lions. We swimmed very close with them and they're were very playful. I never seen so many sea lions so close and playful. Amazing!

#### Scuba Diving

- Iguana: 190$ last minute in person
- Shark Bay: 180$ (I think they are the cheapest on the island) last minute in person

I had 5 diving trips on Santa Cruz. I did my first 2 dives with Iguana and the other 3 with Shark Bay. I liked Iguana a lot, they also have a good reputation and are often recommended, they have very good quality equipment incl. 7mm suits, what i appreciate since the water can be cold to very cold (around 22 degress in May with cold streams), the briefing is very detailed and all the time I felt really safe. I went with them to Gordon Rocks, Seymour and Mosquera.

My first dive was in Gordon Rocks and I had an amazing first encounter with a hammershark :) It's the picture you see in the header of this post. And the best is that I was lucky and had almost no current and the visibility was good. The conditions in Gordon Rocks changing every day and a middle to strong inclusive up- and down current are common. My second time in Gordon Rocks was exactly this. At the first dive the current has been okey with some very strong current and we've seen a school of 5-6 Hammerhead sharks at 25 meters :D
The second dive was crazy. Even the guide was surprised so he briefed us with a very calm, relaxing dive. In the end we had to decent fast to grab a rock, deflate the jacket und walking on the rocks for around 30 minutes. It felt like rockclimbing underwater :D

It has been a great experience in Gordon Rocks but in Saymour and Mosquera I also had very good encounters. On ~25 meters I've seen a school of around 10 eagle rays, hammerhead sharks, a lot of white tip sharks und much more.

Once I dove in Daphne and it was amazing! The hightlight was after around 30 minutes divetime. We floated on ~10 meters and we have seen a big bait ball of sardines. I have never seen this before! We dove inside the ball and we have seen sea lions, sharks and turtles swimming though the swarm! Amazing! I didn't research about Daphne before so I was positive surprised by this.

### Isabela

- Where I stayed: 2 nights in the hostel "La Casa de Mike" for 15$ per night in a 3 beds dorm. 6 nights in "Gladys Mar" for 20$ per night in a private room with air condition and you can use a shared kitchen. I recommend Gladys Mar cause it's private and almost the same price as the hostel. I also don't recommend La Casa de Mike cause the beds in the shared room were not bunk beds and I had only a tiny and very loud fan, and the kitchen was very very dirty.
- Cheap local restaurants: 5$
- Coffee: 2,50$ - 5$
- Diving: I did not dive here cause here is only one dive center with a really bad reputation
- Cash vs Card: For local restaurants, shops etc. you definitly need cash. I paid everything in cash. I think here is one atm on the island but better take cash with you to avoid high fees.

Isabela is very different to the other islands. Here is the real island vibe. The most streets are out of sands, there just few restaurants, a stunning beach near the town with a beautiful sunset and beside the Pier is a snorkeling spot and a tiny beach with hammoks - i spend a few days just in this hammoks 🤩

On the first day on Isabela I thought it will be to quite for me. I guess because I had so much action the last 9 days on Santa cruz so I was still full of energy. But after 2 - 3 days I understood the island, I became calm and just enjoyed some days doing nothin and read my book at the beach 🙂

#### Things you can do without a guide

One of the best things you can do is renting a bycicle for 10-15$ per day and ride the way up to ***Wall of Tears***. I recommend to ride all the way to this spot and skip all stops in between as first (you can see them on the way back). When you reach the walls you can go up on the left side. You will see multiple view points with a beautiful view of the town or even the vulcano's of galapagos.
On the way back to town I made a stop at any possible spot. You will see viewpoints, beaches, mangroves, a little jungle hike and for sure you will see one or more tortoise passing by :)
I took my time for this trip, stopped at any spot and finished in 4-5 hours. You can also do it in 1-4 hours.

Discover the beach near town and watch the buetiful sunset Isable's has to offer. It's amazing!
If you able to surf you can also rent a surfing board for 20$ per day and surf while seeing the sunset :) On good spot is near the rocks on the left end of the beach. Probably you will see a lot of local kids surfing or bodysurfing around sunset time.  

See flamingos in the lake **Poza de los Flamingos** in the middle of the town. Best time is either in the morning or around sunset time. Of course you can go anytime but the chance to see flamingos is heigher when it's not that sunny.

Go snorkeling near the pier at **Concha de Perla** and see Iguanas, swimming pinguins, turtles, a lot of sea lions and other tropical fishes.
After the snorkel or any other time you can go to the small beach **Playa Isabela** near the pier. It's a great place to relax, observe sea lions and just read your book in a hammok under the tree.
It's also a great place to be to wait for the ferry!

#### Snorkeling and other trips

- Tintoreras: 45$
- Vulcano Sierra Negra hiking: 45$
- Vulcano Sierra Negra sulfur mines: 65$
- Los tuneles: I don't no and I didn't go there but I heard it's worth to go
- Comorant tour: 240$

The shortest and cheapest tour is **Tintoreras**. You can see pinguins while resting, swimming or nesting. Also you can see turtles and the famous birds blue footed boobies.
You have 3 options to go to this group of small islands.
The most common way to go is by boat and it contains one time snorkeling, seeing pinguins from the boat and stopping at one of the islands to discover by walking.
You can also take the kayak (sadly you cannot rent it on your own) but you're not allowed to snorkel. I like kayaking a lot but the non-snorkeling part was a no-go for me.
The third option is by standup paddle but I just heard about this option and I heard only some agencies offering this so you have to ask around.

#### Scuba Diving

There are not as many tours but I did the tintoreras where I've seen pinguins and alot of other animals. I did hiking at the vulcano Sierra Negra - that has the second largest caldera in the world.

Also I went on a special tour call Comorant Tour. This tour is only happening when there are enough people, the conditions are good and it's only done by one agency called "Whale shark dive center" - even if they doesn't offer scuba diving 🫠
This Tour was amazing! We had a 2 hours boat drive to the west of Isabela around the corner. We had 2 snorkeling spots. The first was very nice, we've seen alot of turtles, sea lions and swimming pinguins 😍 The sea was rough and it felt like we're in the open sea, what we were.
The sea lions there are even another kind than these near the town. We've seen fur sea lions, that has hair on the body. They're living only at remote areas and in the rocks and they're way more shy and are not that close to the people as the other kind.
On the way back we made a kind of Safari and watched for whales, orcas or manta rays. We've seen some manta rays but the moste were too fast for us. But then we found one that felt okey to swim with us about 30minutes 🤩
So i snorkeled here with my first seen manta ray 🤩 amazing
